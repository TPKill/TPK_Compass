Still alpha.\nSupports Age of Sorcery.\n\nOptions panel is planned for next feature.\nHas not been tested in Client-hosted environment.\n\n\npak file available at: https://github.com/TPKill/TPK_Compass/releases\n",
	"changeNote": "Optimized clan tracking.  It was iterating through all thralls as well as players, wasting RAM and CPU.  Doesn't do that anymore.\nFixed bug where clan pips weren't tracking inside dungeons.\nAdded distant clan-member tracking.  Name popups for distant pips are missing to save bandwidth.  I'm considering adding them as a server-side option.\nBeginning framework for an options panel.",
